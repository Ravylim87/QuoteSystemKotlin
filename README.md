# Overview

In this project, I am trying to create a quote management system that allows users to view, add, and remove quotes.
My long-term goal is to turn it into a mobile app so that I can access it no matter where I go.
, that way i can have a quotation to look at every day... and if I find a favorite Scripture quotation, I can add it to the system as well.Â 
 
The code is a simple Quote Management System that allows the user to manage a list of quotes by performing different operations such as listing, adding, removing, searching, counting, editing and sorting quotes.
The Quote class is used to represent a single quote with a unique quote number and a quote string.
The main function presents the user with a menu of options to choose from, and the user's input determines which operation to perform.
The program uses different functions to implement each operation, such as listQuotes(), addQuote(), removeQuote(), searchQuote(), countQuotes(), editQuote(), and sortQuotes().
The program stores the quotes in a mutable list of Quote objects, which allows the user to modify the list by adding or removing quotes, or by editing the content of an existing quote.

Overall, the code is well-structured and easy to understand. The functions are named appropriately and the code is properly indented, making it easy to read and follow. However, it could benefit from additional error handling to prevent unexpected user inputs.
